As with many open source packages, we use [GitHub](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/SensorToolbox) to do develop and maintain the source, and [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) for continuous integration.
  - If you want to just use SensorToolbox, we suggest using the [latest release](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/SensorToolbox/releases/latest).
  - If you think you have found a bug in the release, or need a feature which isn't in the release, try the latest **untested** builds from the master branch.

## Supported Tools and Releases

We provide support across certain releases of MATLAB. This does not mean older releases will not work but they are not maintained. Currently supported tools are:
- MATLAB R2020a

## Support and Documentation

All support questions should be posted in our [EngineerZone](https://ez.analog.com/linux-device-drivers/linux-software-drivers) forums. Documentation is included within the toolbox but additional documentation is avaible on the [ADI Wiki](https://wiki.analog.com/resources/eval/user-guides/matlab_bsp).
